<h3 id="what-comes-with-foundation-">What Comes With Foundation?</h3>
<p>Well, most everything you need, we hope. Foundation has a ton of components and structures to help you build a responsive site without having to worry about all of your baseline, foundational (see what we did there) code. Here's a snapshot of what every version of Foundation includes:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3><a href="components/grid.html"><strong>The Grid</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our grid works on almost any device and has support for nesting, source ordering, offsets and device presentation. Frankly it's a little too easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3><a href="components/offcanvas.html"><strong>Navigation</strong></a></h3>
<p>People have to get around. Navigation styles in Foundation include a bitchin' off-canvas implementation, a robust top bar, and a bunch of other navigational constructs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3><a href="components/button.html"><strong>Buttons</strong></a></h3>
<p>Clicking on stuff is awesome, so hook up your users with buttons to do stuff. We've included styles for size, presentation, color and more so making a button is as easy as adding a class.</p>
</div>
<div class="medium-6 columns">
<h3><a href="components/interchange.html"><strong>Plugins</strong></a></h3>
<p>We've included a ton of JS plugins written just for Foundation to optimize your page (Interchange), show off images (Clearing), pop up modals (Reveal) and tons more.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="-and-so-much-more-seriously-">...and so much more. Seriously.</h3>
<p>That's just a snapshot of everything in Foundation. Check out all the components here through the docs — there are explanations, code examples, rendered examples and everything you need to build the components in Foundation with HTML, CSS, or Sass. Go forth and make awesome things.</p>
